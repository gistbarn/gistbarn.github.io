# brutal.js (1.9.1)

Minimalist framework for building JS apps.

[Tests](https://thiscris.com/brutal.js/tests/)

## Features

- Uses native JS features and requires no transpilation or build step.
- Fully isomorphic, running browser-side or server-side (with builtin hydration).
- Use normal HTML conventions (omit some end tags, omit quotes, lowercase attr names ~ unlike JSX).
- Add event listeners inline using either the lowercased event name, with or without the standard `on` prefix.
- Small, fast and XSS safe. 
- Can be used in place of Deku, lit-html or React.

## Installing

From NPM:

```shell
$ npm i --save brutalist-web
```

Then using on server with CJS:

```JavaScript
  const {R} = require('brutalist-web');
```

Or using on server with ESM:

```JavaScript
  import {R} from 'brutalist-web';
```

Using on client with the Unpkg CDN:

```HTML
  <script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/brutalist-web/r.js></script>
```

Consider relative paths if you want to self-host.
For example, (you probably wouldn't do this): if you were serving your node_modules directory,
at the `/node_modules` path, and the script importing was serving from the `/app` path, you would import like:

`/app/script.js`:

```JavaScript
  import {R} from '../node_modules/brutalist-web/r.js';
```

*Note: The client imports require you to specify `r.js` while the server does not.
This is owing to the current slightly different syntax and semantics of ES imports
between client and server.*

## Simple Example

This is Brutal.js:

```JavaScript
function ButtonWidget({name}) {
  return R`
    <button click=${() => showModal(name)}>
      Show ${name} Modal
    </button>
  `;
}
```

## More examples

For more extensive examples, [the tests listed above](https://thiscris.com/brutal.js/tests/), or see [a TodoMVC app written in Brutal.js](https://github.com/crislin2046/rvanillatodo). Also take a look at the component code in [Brutestrap UI Kit](https://github.com/crislin2046/brutestrap), a UI Kit being built with Brutal.js (and incorporating [C3S](https://github.com/crislin2046/c3s) for scoping styles to components).

## Basic documentation

### Handlers 

There's two ways to add event handlers to your markup. 

Either directly in the template string with `eventName=${functionValue}` syntax or by passing an object with 
`handlers=${handlersObj}` syntax.

The handlers object must map event names to function values. 

Example:

```JavaScript
const handlers = {
  click: e => console.log(e),
  mouseover: e => alert(e)
};
R`<input handlers=${handlers}>`
```

is equivalent to:
```JavaScript
R`<input click=${e => console.log(e)} mouseover=${e => alert(e)}>`;
```

### Multiple listeners per event

In order to add multiple listeners, use an array of functions:

```JSX
R`<button click=${[
    e => console.log(e), 
    f => { if ( f.target.matches('[value="clear"]') ) f.target.closest('form').reset() }
  ]}>Clear Form</button>`;
  ```
  
### Where does Brutal come from?

Brutal is a project to build a minimal framework for JS apps in non-transpiled pure ECMAScript. 

It does minimal DOM updates without the use of a virtual DOM. It uses template literals instead of JSX. The main file (r.js) is just 500 SLOC. 

It came out of two projects I did to attempt to build a React-like API without using React's source code or JSX at all. I followed the React Tutorial and built the minimal amount of code to copy the demos given in the tutorial. The projects (with live demos as GitHub pages) are:

- [Racked.js - React without Babel in 500 lines](https://github.com/crislin2046/racked-js-react-without-babel-in-500-lines)
- [Explore React without React](https://github.com/crislin2046/explore-react-without-react)
